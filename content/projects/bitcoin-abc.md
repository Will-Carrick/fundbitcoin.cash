# About

The goal of Bitcoin ABC is to create sound money that is usable by everyone in the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many orders of magnitude beyond current limits.
